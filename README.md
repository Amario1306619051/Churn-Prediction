# Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction

Customer Churn Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at helping businesses analyze and predict customer churn. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical metric for businesses to understand, as it represents the percentage of customers who stop using a product or service during a given time period.

In this project, we use various machine learning models to analyze customer data and predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. We have employed popular Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization, and model building.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Data Import**: We import the customer data from an external source using Pandas.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We perform EDA to understand the dataset better. This includes univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover insights about customer behavior.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: We clean the data, convert non-numeric columns to numeric using Label Encoding, and remove unnecessary columns.

4. **Model Building**: We build machine learning models to predict customer churn. In this example, we have used Logistic Regression for demonstration purposes.

5. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the model's performance using metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.

## Features

- Import and preprocess customer data
- Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights
- Build machine learning models for churn prediction
- Evaluate model performance

## Usage

You can use this project as a template for your own customer churn prediction analysis. You can replace the dataset with your own data, select different machine learning algorithms, and fine-tune the models to suit your specific business needs.
